Deciphering Messages

Ciphering messages has been a popular way to relay secret messages since ancient civilization. One of the most famous examples of a cipher is Caesar's Cipher. Caesar’s Cipher is an example of a monoalphabetic cipher - where a single alphabet is used to encrypt and decrypt messages. Typically in these alphabets, the same English letters are used, but there is some type of algorithm that is used to shift the order. In the traditional case of Caesar’s Cipher, the alphabet is shifted to the “right”, or “down”, 3 spots. In this case, Code:You would end up as “Frgh:Brx”.
